It presents a play that was created in 1651 at the Jesuit college in Ljubljana. The author of the play was the Ljubljana native Johann Ludwig Schönleben (1618–1681), who was initially a Jesuit and then, after leaving the order, served as a diocesan priest and later as the Ljubljana cathedral dean. He was a versatile Carniolan man of letters, historian, preacher, Mariologist theologian, philosopher—and, as this critical edition shows, a playwright as well.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-402"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>This Jesuit play, which was written in Slovenia by a locally born author, is taken from the privacy of the archives and presented to the Slovenian general public in order to unveil a long (1597–1773) but poorly known chapter in Slovenian theater history that was shaped by the Jesuits with their school and religious performances.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-403"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>There are multiple reasons for publishing the critical edition of the play<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span>. Content and dramaturgical analyses of the play show that it is well-thought-out in terms of its theme and content, refined in terms of dramaturgy, and carefully worked-out in the performative sense. It was created during a period when the dramatic activity of the Ljubljana Jesuits was especially lively (1640–1672), with several school and religious performances held every year. The choice of this play was also influenced by the fact that it is one of the rare plays by the Ljubljana Jesuits whose authorship is indisputably attested. This play also has a central place in research on Jesuit dramatic activity in Slovenian territory because it was discovered first. Prior to that, there was no known Jesuit play preserved in its entirety that had originated from Ljubljana, and so studies on manifestations of the Jesuit order’s theater in Slovenia were limited to a few preserved program notes (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">periochae</span>; that is, summaries of the content of the plays by acts and usually with lists of cast members).</p><div class="subchapter" id="summary.1.1"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-254">Discovery of the play Haeresis fulminata</span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-404"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Although the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> was known by title due to its mention in Jesuit sources—and from these it was known that program notes were printed for its performance—details about the play were unknown. Printed specimens of the Latin and German program notes were not preserved, and the manuscript of the play, which was first mentioned by Peter Radics in the introduction and supplement to his 1865 edition of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Der verirrte Soldat</span>, was considered lost. Along with <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span>, Radics mentioned the titles of some other Ljubljana plays that he had seen while organizing the former Auersperg Trust Library in Ljubljana.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-405"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The vagaries of fate dictated that Radics was the first to mention all these texts and also the last to see them. When Ljubljana was struck by an earthquake in 1895, it also badly damaged the Auersperg palace, and so both its library and archive were transferred to Losensteinleiten Castle in Upper Austria. The library was later relocated to Uruguay and then to London, where much of the collection was sold at auction by Sotheby’s in 1982 and 1983. The Auersperg family archive was later turned over to the National Archives of Austria (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Österreichisches Staatsarchiv</span>)—specifically, to its House, Court, and State Archives (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv</span>) in Vienna. All traces of the Ljubljana Jesuits’ plays and program notes were lost during the relocations, sales, and transfers of the Auersperg library and archives.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-406"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The discovery of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> in 2013 during the course of research on Johann Ludwig Schönleben was a great surprise to me. Because it was considered lost—it was presumed that that it had been sold off together with other manuscripts and books in 1982 and 1982—its discovery raised new questions and led to more detailed study of the former library of the Auerspergs and their preserved family archives. Tracing Radics’s organization of the Auersperg library and archives showed that Radics removed certain specimens of library material from the regular library stock that he considered to have special significance for the Auersperg family because of their form (manuscripts and incunabula), content, and dedications, and he placed them in a section that he dubbed <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Auerspergiaca</span>. Because his organization of the library was disrupted by the earthquake and relocation of the library, and later its sale, it was not possible to determine the fate of this section. The discovery of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> therefore reawakened hope that this entire section or at least part of it might be preserved in the Auersperg family archives.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-407"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>This anticipation was initially followed by disappointment when it was established that the plays and program notes were not listed in the inventory of preserved archival material. The hope remained that they might be hiding somewhere and would be discovered in overlooked corners of the archive that were still not inventoried. Therefore in the first months of the postdoctoral project I prepared a list of potentially preserved plays and program notes by the Ljubljana Jesuits based on preserved inventories and catalogs from the Auersperg library, Radics’s testimonies in the introduction and supplement to his edition of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Der verirrte Soldat</span>, and details that could be gathered from his records on organizing the library. With the help of Luka Ručigaj and Maria Zdislava Röhsner, the curator of the Auersperg family material at the House, Court, and State Archives in Vienna, who permitted inspection of material still not inventoried, these sought for and greatly desired plays were found in October 2018 in part of the archive not inventoried. They were awaiting discovery in a rather undistinguished place: in an old banana box.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-408"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Because the trail to the main discovery of theater material by the Ljubljana Jesuits was laid by unearthing Schönleben’s play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span>, which was the first to be found, and because it is also such a well-conceived and well-written work, it is also the first to be examined in detail. The play is also interesting in terms of its theme because it presents a combination of political and church history—and not just any, but the period that led to the first major ecclesiastical schism between East and West: the Acacian schism. Understanding the political backgrounds, theological theories, and frictions between them clarifies individual aspects of the themes used and contributes to a better understanding of the story of the play and the goals that Schönleben wished to achieve by staging it.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="summary.1.2"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-255">The title of Schönleben's play</span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-409"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The full title of Schönleben’s play is <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata. Anastasius Tyrannus Orientis Haereticus</span>. Judging by the manner in which the title is written, it can be concluded that the first phrase, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> (literally, ‘heresy struck/destroyed by lightning’), is the primary title, and the second phrase—especially if the dot separating the primary and secondary titles is viewed as the conventional sive or seu ‘or, that is’—is an explanatory title: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Anastasius Tyrannus Orientis Haereticus</span> (‘Anastasius, the Heretical Tyrant of the East’). Because it is difficult to convey the Latin compactness of the title in Slovenian, the title was translated in a sentential manner: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Strela udari krivoverca</span> ‘Lightning Strikes a Heretic’. Although the central place in the title is occupied by the word <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">haeresis</span> ‘heresy’, which Schönleben used in the text with various shades of meaning, the translation uses the word metonymically. It designates a heretic, who is primarily the incarnation of something concrete (i.e., Anastasius), and indirectly of course any kind of heresy. In this manner, the Slovenian translation seeks to reflect the plasticity of the original title image—that is, the thunderbolt, and thus clearly illustrate what Schönleben wanted to achieve with the play: to portray the cruel end of any kind of heresy through the fate of the protagonist Anastasius. The decision to use a metonymic translation also proved very fitting because it summarizes in one sentence what Schönleben additionally clarified in the play’s secondary title: »Heresy—[that is,] Anastasius, the heretical tyrant of the East—struck by lightning.«</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="summary.1.3"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-256">Themes of the play Haeresis fulminata</span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-410"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Schönleben defined his play as a tragedy on the title page, and it can be added that it is a play with a historical theme. It can be categorized as an allegorical and didactic Christian play. The play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> outlines the cunning ascent of Anastasius, an official in the Byzantine court, to the throne of the Byzantine Empire. Anastasius decides to depose the reigning emperor, Zeno, with the help of Zeno’s wife Ariadne. He takes advantage of her affection and infatuation to include her in his criminal plan. Because Zeno enjoys his wine too much, Anastasius intoxicates him with Ariadne’s help, declares him dead with his accomplices, and together with Ariadne seals him alive in a sarcophagus. When cries are later heard from the sarcophagus, the courtiers in favor of Anastasius ignore them and let Zeno die. To these themes, Schönleben added another important theme of the play in the scene showing Anastasius’s enthronement as emperor: Anastasius’s heresy, which manifested itself in his propensity for Monophysitism. For this reason, at the request of Patriarch Euphemius, he had to sign a declaration of orthodoxy before his enthronement. From this theme, Schönleben then developed others, among which the most prominent is Anastasius’s violent confrontation with his political and religious opponents and his cruelty to innocent and simple people. All this led to his ruin and eventually to dying by being struck by lightning. Even more fateful for him than lightning, however, was his judgment before God, which plunged him into eternal doom and death. Even though the character of the heretical Emperor Anastasius is at the forefront of the play, Schönleben probably wanted to present the sad fate of any heresy to the audience more than Anastasius’s ruin and to draw parallels with Lutheranism on Carniolan soil.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="summary.1.4"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-257">Content of the digital critical edition <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> – <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Lightning Strikes a Heretic</span></span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-411"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The first part of the digital critical edition <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata – Strela udari krivoverca </span>presents the play at three levels. The original appearance of the play is presented with digital facsimiles, which show the script as well as the flyleaves and covers. The diplomatic transcription of the text is the connecting link between the manuscript original and the critical transcription of the text, whose role in this edition is assumed by the translation of the Latin text into Slovenian. Because this is a complex play whose details cannot be systematically examined separately from the text itself, these are collected and explained in a critical apparatus directly next to the translation of the play into Slovenian.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-412"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The second part of the edition consists of accompanying studies. The first part describes the codicological and paleographic characteristics of the manuscript and the ecdotic principles of the edition. This is followed by a presentation of Schönleben’s maturation as a playwright. His first contacts with Jesuit theater production, his early experiments with drama, and his interest in the beginnings of the dramatic creativity of the Jesuit college in Ljubljana are described. The study continues by focusing on the manuscript of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span>, its content and special features, and preserved testimonies in sources about its staging. It can be concluded from the content of the play and stage directions that music and dance played an important role in the performance, and so places that especially confirm this are highlighted in particular. Of interest was the extent to which Schönleben’s crafting of the play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> was independent, and to what extent he was influenced by others, and so performances of plays with a similar theme are presented, both before and after Schönleben. The motives and other impulses that guided him in writing the play are also presented.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-413"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>This is followed by an attempt to contextualize Schönleben’s play in the time and broader environment of the Jesuit order’s theater. Because the topic of Schönleben’s play relates to the colorful political and religious history of the Byzantine Empire in the late fifth and early sixth centuries, the historical background of the reign of Emperor Anastasius I is outlined. Religious conflicts and theological divisions from the time before he assumed power and especially during his time are also described. All of this is done to clarify the individual segments of the dramatic narrative and make it easier to follow what is happening in the play. Explanation of the historical background also somewhat clarifies Schönleben’s selection of themes. The more detailed content of the play is presented through the program notes, integrated in the core text of the play: individual scenes and choruses in the play are introduced by short summaries and a list of the speakers. The presentation of Schönleben’s play concludes with an outline of the literary character of the play.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="summary.1.5"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-258">Purpose of the digital critical edition</span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-414"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Preserved fragments of Jesuit play production in Ljubljana and reports about it testify that Jesuit religious theater in Slovenian territory was certainly an important element in the general cultural and theatrical development of the country due to its relatively long existence (over 170 years) and due to regular performances. It developed a sense of aesthetic appreciation of theater and drama, and it undoubtedly played a fundamental role in defining the further development of Slovenian theater culture. The approaches that the Jesuits selected for this, how they shaped dramatic stories, and how they staged them and presented them to audiences can only be indicated by the preserved play scripts themselves. Therefore, the main purpose of the digital critical edition of the Jesuit play <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata</span> is to present the preserved manuscript text from different angles, allow genuine contact with the text, and make concrete at least part of such an important period for Slovenian theater history.</p></div></div><div class="subchapter" id="summary.2"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-259">Ecdotic principles of the editions</span></h3><div class="subchapter" id="summary.2.1"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="haeresis.en-head-260">Facsimiles</span></h4><p id="haeresis.en-p-415"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The digital critical edition <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Haeresis fulminata </span>– <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Strela udari krivoverca</span> also presents the manuscript text of the play in its original form in order to allow the reader to have authentic contact with the text.

Directly next to the translation, a critical apparatus is added, which includes an explanation of all the features of the play that are difficult to explain separately from the text itself.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-442"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The translation follows the metrical scheme of the original, so that Latin forms are mostly translated into analogous Slovenian ones, of course in line with the principles of Slovenian metrics, and in some cases replaced by similar ones (in structure and length). A characteristic of the play is the large number of shared lines, when verse lines are shared or split between two or even more speakers. Because it was sometimes difficult, and sometimes almost impossible, to preserve the metrical scheme of the original verse and at the same time properly convey the meaning of the Latin original in Slovenian, it was necessary to adopt some compromise solutions in some places. As a result, the meaning, metrical scheme of verse lines (with the aforementioned adjustments), and the final number of lines of text in the Latin original and the Slovenian translation remained the same, but this caused quite a few problems in the parallel presentation of the diplomatic transcription and the translation.</p><p id="haeresis.en-p-443"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Because the symbols for pauses (—) in the Latin original are not vital for the Slovenian meaning, they are not taken into account in the Slovenian translation.
